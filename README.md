## Objective:
The goal of this project is to develop a predictive model for house prices based on the linear regression algorithm. By analyzing a dataset that includes information about various features of houses, such as living area, and their corresponding sale prices, the project aims to build a model that accurately predicts house prices.

## Key Steps:

## Data Exploration:

Begin by loading and exploring the dataset to understand its structure and contents.
Identify key features, with a focus on the 'Living Area' as a primary predictor of house prices.
Data Visualization:

Utilize data visualization techniques, such as scatter plots, to visually inspect the relationship between 'Living Area' and 'Sale Price.'
Explore other relevant visualizations to gain insights into the dataset's distribution and patterns.
Data Preprocessing:

Address any missing values or outliers in the dataset to ensure the quality of the model.
Prepare the data by selecting relevant features and the target variable ('Sale Price').
Linear Regression Model:

Implement a linear regression model, treating 'Living Area' as the independent variable and 'Sale Price' as the dependent variable.
Train the model on a training dataset, and evaluate its performance on a separate testing dataset.
Model Evaluation:

Assess the model's accuracy using metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) or R-squared.
Interpret the model's coefficients to understand the impact of 'Living Area' on 'Sale Price.'
Prediction:

Apply the trained model to make predictions on new or unseen data.
Visualize the model's predictions against the actual sale prices to assess its effectiveness.
Key Insights and Interpretation:

Analyze the visualizations and model results to draw insights into how changes in living area correlate with changes in sale prices.
Discuss any limitations or areas for improvement in the model.
